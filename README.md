# BingSearchApp

BingSearchApp is a simple ReactJS application that leverages the Bing Search API to provide search results. The project is built using Vite for fast development and Shadcn/UI for UI components.

# Installation
To run the project, you only need Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictorlReis/bing-search-app.git
```
### Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd BingSearchApp
```

### Install dependencies using npm:

```bash Copy code
npm install
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server using Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will build the project and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:5173. You can now interact with the BingSearchApp and explore the search functionality.

## Environment Variables
Before running the application, ensure that you have obtained a Bing Search API key from Microsoft Azure. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your API key:

```env

```
Replace YOUR-KEY with your actual Bing Search API key.
